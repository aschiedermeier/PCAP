A: Unicode assigns unique (unambiguous) characters (letters, hyphens, ideograms, etc.) to more than a million code points. 
The first 128 Unicode code points are identical to ASCII, 
and the first 256 Unicode code points are identical to the ISO/IEC 8859-1 code page (a code page designed for western European languages).

B: One of the most commonly used is UTF-8.
The name is derived from Unicode Transformation Format.
The concept is very smart. UTF-8 uses as many bits for each of the code points as it really needs to represent them.

C: The system named ASCII (short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most widely used, 
and you can assume that nearly all modern devices (like computers, printers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.) use that code.
The code provides space for 256 different characters, but we are interested only in the first 128. 

D: The Python Language Reference is the official reference manual that
describes the syntax and semantics of the Python language.

E,F:First of all, Python's strings (or simply strings, as we're not going to discuss any other language's strings) are immutable sequences.
Strings aren't lists, but you can treat them like lists in many particular cases.
Moreover, everything you know about slices is still usable.

G: Lists and strings in Python can be sliced.
